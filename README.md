# Ecg_Simulator
ECG Signal Simulator
Overview
This project presents a basic ECG Signal Simulator developed in Python, aimed at simulating normal ECG signals with variable beats per minute (BPM). ECG signal simulation is an essential tool for studying and understanding the distinct components of the signal and analyzing cardiac health. This simulator offers three different BPM rate options, allowing for flexible testing and analysis of ECG signal characteristics at various heart rates.

Features
Three BPM Rate Options: Generate ECG signals at three preset heart rates, simulating normal, slow, and fast heart rates.
Custom ecg_function: Developed from a conference paper and inspired by the MATLAB code for ECG simulation available on the official website of MATLAB.
Python Implementation: Accessible, easy-to-use Python code suitable for educational and research purposes.
Purpose
Simulating ECG signals can be highly beneficial for:

Understanding ECG signal morphology and its components.
Developing and testing ECG-based algorithms.
Research and analysis in cardiac health.
Usage
Clone the repository and run the provided Python script to simulate ECG signals at different BPM rates. This simulator can be modified to test additional BPM rates or other ECG parameters.
